# Solar-System-unity
It's my first project in unity. The Unity Solar System Simulation is a 3D project that aims to provide an immersive and educational experience of our solar system. This project utilizes the Unity game development engine to create a visually appealing and interactive simulation of celestial bodies within the solar system.
